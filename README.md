# MY_PENTESTING_JOURNEY
Hi, my name is ISAAC OLATUNJI
Embark on my penetration testing journey and basic documentation through this repository. 
This is driven by my curiosity and a fervent passion for debugging and uncovering vulnerabilities as I figured biulding web applications is not something I enjoy, I bring a intermediate foundation in web developmentâ€”proficient in HTML, CSS, Django framework, Javascript, and SQL. In this repository, I am trying to document my exploration into the dynamic world of ethical hacking. Join me as I channel my skills in general towards securing the digital space.
