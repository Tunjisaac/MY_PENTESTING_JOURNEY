  Vulnerability Description:  
An HTML Injection vulnerability has been identified on the search field of the xxx Federal Credit Union (xxxfcu.org) website. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML code into the search input field, potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as page redirection to malicious websites. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could craft and inject a specially designed payload to manipulate the behavior of the website and redirect users to an unintended and potentially harmful destination.

  Vulnerability Impact:  
The impact of this vulnerability can be severe. If successfully exploited, an attacker could trick users into unknowingly visiting malicious websites that could distribute malware, steal sensitive information, or engage in phishing attacks. This could undermine the trust and security of xxx Federal Credit Union's website, exposing its users to various risks.

  Vulnerable Component:  
The vulnerable component is the search input field present on the xxxfcu.org website.

.button {background-color: #11466b;color: white;} </style></head><button class="button button1">Verify</button> ”  (without “ ”)

4. Press the "Search" button or trigger the search action.

  Impact Demonstration:  
Upon successful exploitation of the vulnerability, the web page will redirect users to "https://google.com," which can also be a malicious website or a xxxfcu.org website clone(SCAMPAGE) which is a demonstration of the potential impact. In a real-world scenario, the malicious site could be designed to perform more harmful actions, such as downloading malware onto the user's device or collecting sensitive information.The link that processed with the processed payload can be sent to xxxFCU members.
